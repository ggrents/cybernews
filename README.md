## About

My project is an esports news portal developed using the powerful and flexible Django framework. I created this project with one goal - to provide fans and professionals of esports with one place where they can keep up to date with all the events and the latest news from this exciting world.

I strive to provide our users with the most up-to-date information about tournaments, teams, players and emerging trends. Our team of experts carefully analyzes matches, conducts interviews with professionals and creates informative articles and reviews.

We believe that esports is more than just entertainment, it is a passion, profession and lifestyle for many. That's why I dedicated myself to creating this portal to gather all the necessary information in one place and help our users stay up to date with all the events.

Creating this project on Django allowed us to create a reliable and scalable platform where esports and news about it become closer to people. I hope that you will enjoy our portal and find here all the necessary information about your favorite area in the world of esports..




## Documentation

Welcome to the documentation of our project! Our esports news portal was created using the powerful Django framework and provides a wide range of functionality for anyone interested in the world of esports.

------------Dependencies-------------

My Django project uses various Python libraries and packages to provide its functionality. These dependencies are specified in the file requirements.txt which makes the installation process very convenient.
After activating the virtual environment, you will work in an isolated environment where only the dependencies of your project will be installed. This helps to avoid conflicts between different projects and simplifies dependency management.
Now, after installing the dependencies and activating the virtual environment, your Django project should be ready to launch.

--------------Using the project---------------

1. Viewing articles:

Users can easily view articles about esports on our portal. The articles are organized in a convenient list, and each article includes a title, a brief description, and a publication date. When clicking on an article, the user can read it in full.

2. Registration and authorization:

Users have the opportunity to create an account on our portal to access all functions and create their own profile. To do this, follow these steps:

Registration: Users can register a new account by choosing a unique username and password. After successful registration, they will be sent a confirmation to the specified email address.

Authorization: Users can log in to their account using their nickname and password. Authorization provides access to functions that are available only to registered users.

Password Recovery: If the user has forgotten his password, he can request a password reset via email. The system will send him a link to create a new password.

After registration and / or authorization, users can add articles, leave comments, search and enjoy all the functionality of our portal about esports.

Thus, the addition of a registration and authorization system provides users with more opportunities to interact with your project.

3. Adding articles:

Registered users have the opportunity to add their own articles on our portal. When adding an article, they can specify the title, content, select a category and assign tags to improve the search. This allows users to share information and opinions about esports.

4. Leaving comments:

Users can leave comments under each article of our portal. This allows you to create discussions and share opinions with other members of the esports community. Comments can be added after authorization on the site.

5. Search by words and tags:

We provide the ability to perform article searches using keywords and tags. Users can find articles of interest to them by entering keywords in the search bar. Tags also help classify and organize articles for easier access.

6. Selection of categories:

The articles of our portal are divided into categories. Users can select a category that interests them and view articles related to that topic.
